# Bluetooth-Low-Energy-iOS-Application
This is an UI developped during my bachelor thesis at University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland.

The goal of this thesis was to develop a Bluetooth Low Energy based device where a guitar was plugged into, analysed the tone of the guitar
and sended the information to another BLE device acting as a human interface. I used an iPad and developped the entire iOS application. 

I also had to design the electrical schematics for the HW, build and test the HW as well as developping the whole software.
